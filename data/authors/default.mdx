Hi, I'm Thevesh! Whenever I'm asked to introduce myself professionally, I call myself a civil servant because that's the job title I feel most strongly about. However, I'm also an economist, data scientist/engineer/analyst (whatever they're calling it these days), and amateur geospatialist.

I'm a simple guy - I care about my family, friends, and country, and do my best to give my best to all 3. I sometimes get it wrong, and get a much-appreciated kick up my behind from someone who cares about me.

I'm a lucky guy - at this stage in life, my profession is my passion, and I have a lot of fun doing what I do. Beyond that, I enjoy playing squash, playing/listening to music, and solving puzzles (Sudoku, crosswords, you get the drift).

You may have seen me [on X / Twitter](https://x.com/thevesh), the only social media site where I'm actually active. If so, hi again!
