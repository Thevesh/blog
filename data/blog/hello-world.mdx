summary: 'I wanted to start writing long(er)-form content. I wanted to dabble in frontend development. I needed a place to consolidate and organise my writings. Deploying my own blog-cum-site seemed like a good way to do all three.'

## Introduction

As logged on [who.is](https://who.is/whois/thevesh.com), I have owned the [thevesh.com](#) domain since 24th June, 2017. I first purchased it for £10 when I was a student, at the same time that I purchased a couple of other domains for projects I was working on. When I did so, I promised myself that I wouldn't use [thevesh.com](#) for a Wordpress or Medium or Substack-powered site, but would save it for a site that I ‘built' myself. Well, the year is 2024, and I finally did it - I forked a really awesome [NextJS blog template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) that I'd been eyeing for a while, and deployed it on Vercel.

So, why now? And more fundamentally, why?

## The universe gave me multiple signs

In my previous life (as a student), I used to write a lot. I've done it on various platforms at different stages of my life - Blogspot in high school (2009-13), Wordpress in college (2014-16), and Medium in university (2016-19). All ran their course and died a natural death. At some point, I'll port some of the content over to this site because quite a bit (especially the nerdy material) is stuff I'd put my name to without hesitation even today.

When I started work, I stopped (publicly) writing long-form content entirely. All my writing was done at and for work. And to be honest, I was perfectly content with this state of affairs.

Things changed in the October of 2022, because I started tweeting about the 15th Malaysian General Election. Specifically, I started tweeting lots of [election-related dataviz](https://twitter.com/Thevesh/status/1585248940425105409). I initially did for a very silly reason - I was generating a lot of dataviz for my own amusement, and I wanted to send it to friends and family. Rather than sending and re-sending the content in multiple chats, I decided to just tweet it and share a link.

I didn't expect it to take off, but it did. And so began my new persona as a ‘Twitter data scientist'. And while I very much still enjoy communicating data (specifically via Twitter, which encourages me to be succinct and punchy), this nagging feeling that I needed to write longer-form content where I discussed data more thoughtfully and rigorously kept growing inside me.

In 2024, I received several 'nudges' to finally get down to, one after another:
- After a 30-minute call with my grandfather (who I call Nanaji) where I discussed blood donation data with him, he said that I should write it down properly on a website so he could read it.
- Several followers on Twitter asked me to start a Substack.
- A freshman at a Canadian university emailed me with the recommendation to turn some of my tweets into research articles.
- Shahril Hamdan expressed an aspiration to write longer-form content on the Keluar Sekejap podcast.
