summary: 'I wanted to start writing long(er)-form content. I wanted to dabble in frontend development. I needed a place to consolidate and organise my writings. Deploying my own blog-cum-site seemed like a good way to do all three.'

## Introduction

As logged on [who.is](https://who.is/whois/thevesh.com), I have owned the [thevesh.com](#) domain since 24th June, 2017. I first purchased it for £10 when I was a student, at the same time that I purchased a couple of other domains for projects I was working on. When I did so, I promised myself that I wouldn't use [thevesh.com](#) for a Wordpress or Medium or Substack-powered site, but would save it for a site that I ‘built' myself. Well, the year is 2024, and I finally did it - I forked a really awesome [NextJS blog template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) that I'd been eyeing for a while, and deployed it on Vercel.

So, why now? And more fundamentally, why?
