## Introduction

As logged on [who.is](https://who.is/whois/thevesh.com), I have owned the [thevesh.com](#) domain since 24th June, 2017. I first purchased it for £10 when I was a student, at the same time that I purchased a couple of other domains for projects I was working on. When I did so, I promised myself that I wouldn't use [thevesh.com](#) for a Wordpress or Medium or Substack-powered site, but would save it for a site that I ‘built' myself. Well, the year is 2024, and I finally did it - I forked a really awesome [NextJS blog template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) that I'd been eyeing for a while, and deployed it on Vercel.

So, why now? And more fundamentally, why?

## Reason 1: The universe gave me a nudge

In my previous life (as a student), I used to write a lot. I've done it on various platforms at different stages of my life - Blogspot in high school (2009-13), Wordpress in college (2014-16), and Medium in university (2016-19). All ran their course and died a natural death.[^1] However, there was a break in this trend when my career began - I stopped (publicly) writing long-form content entirely. All my writing was done at and for work. And to be honest, I was perfectly content with this state of affairs - I appreciate having a private life, and saw no reason to post my thoughts publicly.

Things changed in the October of 2022, because I started tweeting about the 15th Malaysian General Election. Specifically, I started tweeting lots of [election-related dataviz](https://twitter.com/Thevesh/status/1585248940425105409). I initially did for a very silly reason - I was generating a lot of dataviz for my own amusement, and wanted to send it to friends and family. Rather than sending and re-sending the content in multiple chats, I decided to just tweet it as a single source which I could link to.

I didn't expect it to take off, but it did. And so began my new persona as a ‘Twitter data scientist'. And while I very much still enjoy communicating data (specifically via Twitter, which encourages me to be succinct and punchy), this nagging feeling that I needed to write longer-form content where I discussed data more thoughtfully and rigorously kept growing inside me.

In 2024, I received several 'nudges' to finally get down to it, one after another:
- My grandfather (Nanaji), after a 30-minute call where we discussed blood donation data, said that I should write it down properly on a website so he could read it.
- Several followers on Twitter asked me to start a Substack.
- A freshman at a Canadian university emailed me with the recommendation to turn some of my tweets into articles.
- Shahril Hamdan expressed a similar aspiration to write longer-form content on the [Keluar Sekejap](https://www.youtube.com/@keluarsekejap) podcast.[^2]

So I decided to stop procrastinating and do it. Turned out to be not-that-difficult - I spun the site up in 1.5 hours on the 23rd of January when I woke up early.

## Reason 2: My brain needs it

Writing long-form content at work isn't the same as writing for pleasure and to your own standards. At work, I'm constantly satisficing, because you need to make a tradeoff between speed and quality. Often, taking a piece from B+ to A+ quality (in terms of writing, not content) might make little difference to its impact if the underlying information is the same. Also, writing at work is usually collaborative unless I'm a clear unmatched expert - which means that any stylistic choices will likely be amended as a document is ‘cleared' up the heirarchy.

Comparatively, when I write publicly on a site like this, I fuss over every word. I think of the best mental framework for presenting my jumble of ideas. And because my name (and reputation) are attached to it, I have skin in the game - my personal standards (okay lah, pride) won't let me put out subpar work.

This is an immensely positive influence on my life! Even as I'm writing this entry, I can feel my brain shaking off accummulated rust and settling into a happy place where the literary gears are running smoothly.

## Reason 3: My content needs a home

I need a place to catalogue my work. This isn't just to assist the job of browsing it neatly, but also so that there is a ‘one-stop centre' where fellow professionals can go to browse my writing. If you think about it, it's actually a portfolio of sorts - nothing tells you more about a person than their writing.[^3]

Also, when I want to share a piece of analysis I've put out into the world, I'd much rather share a link to [thevesh.com](#reason-3-my-content-needs-a-home) than to a Tweet. There's something about sharing a link to your social media that feels much more self-aggrandising than sharing a link to your long-form content. Maybe it's because you see all the interactions around a tweet rather than just the ideas, or maybe it's the fact that I really dislike sharing my social media to anyone who doesn't organically follow me. 

## Commitment?

Nothing firm for now, but I hope to try and write here at least at the same frequency as I tweet. That's roughly once per week. If I can keep to that for 2024, I'd count this as a successful endeavour.

And finally, to you reading this, thanks for following along. I am writing for myself, but I'm also writing for you.

[^1]: At some point, I'll port some of the content over to this site because quite a bit (especially the nerdy material) is stuff I'd put my name to without hesitation even today.

[^2]: I follow every episode of the podcast. The content is generally fresh, current, and well-researched. You need to listen to it with a filter (i.e. bearing in mind the hosts' biases and incentives), but that's true for everything in life.

[^3]: I never use generative AI to write; not even as a checking mechanism. I have a basic spell-checker in my editor, and that's it. Best litmus test: people who know me say that they can read what I write in my voice.
